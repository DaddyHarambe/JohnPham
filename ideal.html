            <h1>My Ideal Job</h1>
              <p>
                In the future, I am inspired to pursue my job as an information technology analyst (also called cybersecurity analyst). With the job having a Median salary of $103,590, the individuals are tasked to protect a company’s computer networks and systems. The role of an information analyst is to design and implement security systems to protect a company or organisation's computer networks from cyber attacks. The career caught my eyes as I was looking for a job with good pay as well as being able to do the job while being at any location. My ideal job is related to IT, having good pay and being able to not just work in an office.  The salary is more than enough for me to enjoy my life and the job has a growth of 31% annually according to the job outlook.

                To be qualified as an information security analyst, one must complete a bachelor's degree (technology-related and an industry security certificate. The job requires an individual to have a minimum of 2 to 3 years in the field of information security. The company worldline requires the individual to have a strong understanding of ISO 27001:2013, which is information security management systems as well as having experience working within ISO 27001.

                While I have done some basic information technology subjects in high school such as intro to programming, web design, VET information technology, I have yet to obtain proper industry skills or any knowledge in the security industry. Currently, I am a manager at McDonald and this job has developed me into improving my problem solving and communication skills. Furthermore, the job requires people to have the ability to work under pressure, and working at McDonald’s has pushed me to learn how to handle being under pressure. I currently know basic HTML/CSS  and python. My goal is to fully learn a coding language.
