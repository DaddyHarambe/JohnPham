            <h1>My Interest In IT</h1>
              <p>
                Being a person who likes problem-solving, I have always found IT interesting as I would love to find either hardware and software problems found in either my device or another person. As the growth of technology increases, more jobs are required and the pay may increase. I have always been into technology and I was always the person in the family that solves all the problems with their technology. I have always been a hands-on person, where I would always tear down or fix hardware. I currently have a MacBook(macOS), Ipad pro(IOS), computer (windows) and a Samsung phone(android). I decided to have and learn different operating systems so that I will be able to understand and diagnose problems for each device and operating system.
              </p>

                I decided to choose the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology as the university of my choice as my family and friends suggested and I have done thorough research. The city RMIT provides great convenience for students in terms of transport, as the university is next door to a train station. Living in the western suburbs RMIT is a 30-minute train ride, compared to other universities which could take an hour. Additionally, the city RMIT provides many social clubs such as RAA, RUSU and VSA. Having clubs and restaurants nearby helps create more vibrant and social vibes. Which can lead to making friends more easily.

                While studying information technology at RMIT, I expect to learn not only information technology but to be able to improve my programming language knowledge such as python, HTML and JAVA. Eventually, I would like to learn how to use the information gained from the next 3 to 4 years at RMIT and how it can be applied to the workforce. During my studies, I hope to push my goals and to be able to socialise with new people. Furthermore, being able to study at RMIT is a great privilege and I am greatly motivated to finish my studies and pursue my dreams.
