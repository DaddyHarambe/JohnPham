            <h1>My Project Idea</h1>
              <p>
                My project idea involves using facial recognition to start up one’s car. This would mean a person may enter their car step on the breaks and start their engine without even pushing a button. The user will only have to get in the vehicle and sensors around the driver's side of the car will detect the driver’s face. This would also allow the car to automatically adjust the seats, mirrors and depending on the weather the heating or air conditioning. This would not only make the car more convenient but also a lot more luxurious so that more people may obtain it.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project is interesting as it may allow those who want extra convenience in their lives to access their car through the face alone. This revolutionary idea may enable keys to become obsolete if perfected. This would pair well with another idea though only a concept now and not the primary project idea through fingerprint. Large bulky keys will not be required anymore and forgetting your keys will be the thought of the past. According to the National Motor Vehicle Theft Reduction Council, 70 percent of late-model vehicles are not even using the keys with half of all cars stolen taken from the home. Having this new feature can increase security while greatly reducing the number of cars stolen as they may not have a key anymore.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project will entail facial recognition software and sensors that when a user enters a car the vehicle will automatically detect and scan their face. The user may upload a picture of their face onto the mobile app which will allow the sensors to detect their face. Hidden camera sensors will be implemented throughout the driver side of the vehicle and a primary camera will also be installed where the old ignition button used to be. With this technology implemented, theft becomes almost impossible due to facial recognition. This would also allow the user to get rid of their keys which should declutter their pockets or any spaces the keys would originally be. The car stores the user's information such as seat, mirror and steering wheel’s position. Sensors built into the car will also sense the temperature in the cabin of the car and adjust the air-con or heating accordingly. After scanning the user’s face or fingerprint, the car will automatically adapt to the user and change the car's settings. This should create a more seamless experience for the driver as there would be less features that they would need to manually operate which overall should enhance their driving experience. Facial recognition begins with the capturing of a face from a photo or video. The geometry of a user's face must then be read by facial software. The software then develops a mathematical formula to create an individual's face, Similarly, fingerprint scanners collect the ridges and valleys on a finger's pattern, which is then processed into software that analyses the fingers and compares them to previously stored registered fingerprints. The type of finger scanners that are currently being used are the optical sensor that copies the finger by illuminating it to provide a crisp image of the lines, which the light-sensitive scanner records and converts into a digital image. Additionally, When a finger is placed on the surface, the capacitive sensor monitors the charge because the ridges are able to display the change in capacitance. The data is used by the sensor to precisely map out prints. Lastly, Sound Waves are used by ultrasonic sensors. It's made to send out ultrasonic pulses and track how much of them reflect back. Because ridges and valleys reflect sound differently, ultrasonic software and hardware can produce a precise three-dimensional map of fingerprint patterns.The data gathered by biometric scanners can be stored on a chip and should only be kept for the specific vehicle, as having the data stored on servers could make it easier to hack. These devices' components can be sent to automobile manufacturers, who can then incorporate the functionality into their vehicles. To set up the biometric for the car, the dealership must first obtain a specific key that allows them to access any car without a biometric registration. After purchasing the vehicle, the user must register their fingerprint or face in order to open and start the vehicle without the usage of a special key.

              </p>
              <p>
                The tools and technology required for this project would be intricate and relatively expensive as it requires many different parts. The main component of this system would be the face recognition which would need hardware in order to capture the faces, a software which can compare captured faces and then finally a database system which would be used to store the information that the hardware captures. The sensors would also each require their own software. Once again a separate hardware to the actual fingerprints, an intelligence system to differentiate between other fingerprints, and another database to store these captured prints.
              </p>
              <p>
                An individual or a group with advanced coding knowledge or experience designing biometric devices would be necessary for this project. Face recognition requires written software to recognise a person's face and fingerprint, as well as the ability to encrypt the data to keep it safe from outsiders. People who can create the gear used to capture the photos, such as cameras and fingerprint scanners. These photos are transmitted into a car's software, which is encrypted and stored in the smart car's database. Individuals who are able to communicate the concept to automobile manufacturers in order for the feature to be implemented in future vehicles.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the idea succeeds, the result will be revolutionary as it pushes the ideology of modern technology into our society.  Fundamentally, the project hopes to achieve a goal of reducing the theft rates in the world through the new process of unlocking and starting a car. As a key is no longer required, it will enable a more efficient method to better the world with automobiles.This project's development would be extremely costly in terms of both money and time. Due to the number of people to be hired to design, create, program, manufacture the product, etc. Many prototypes will be created during this procedure to ensure the perfect yet safe way to succeed in this product.
